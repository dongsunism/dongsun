  <p>[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Phoebe, and Monica are there.]</p>
  <strong>Monica</strong>: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!<br>
  <strong>Joey</strong>: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!<br>
  <strong>Chandler</strong>: <span style="color:blue">All right Joey, be nice.</span>  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?<br>
  <strong>Phoebe</strong>: Wait, does he eat chalk?<br>
  (They all stare, bemused.)<br>
  <strong>Phoebe</strong>: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!<br>
  <strong>Monica</strong>: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.<br>
  <strong>Chandler</strong>: Sounds like a date to me.
